        Hi, I'm Isaiah, I am a recent graduate of Ontario Tech University, where I double majored in Applied Mathematics and Physics. I am currently writing a resource 
        that teaches the mathematics behind machine learning algorithms. I have previously worked as a TA where I led laboratory sessions for Physics I & II and taught over 
        100 students per semester. I also previously did research under the supervison of Dr. Sean Bohun for my undergraduate thesis, where I studied the use of Kalman Filtering
        and its use in forecasting equities.  
    </p>
   
    <p>
        I am very interested in Machine Learning and its use in Financial Markets, and how we can use data in order to improve decision making in financial markets, or even
        make more informed decisions for us. Below you can find links to all my pet projects and papers that I have written for my own learning and also for school.
