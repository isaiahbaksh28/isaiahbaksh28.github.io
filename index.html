    <p>
        Hi, I'm Isaiah, I gradauted Ontario Tech University in June 2025. I double majored in Applied Mathematics and Physics and received my BSc. I have previously worked as a TA where I led laboratory sessions for Physics I & II and taught over 
        100 students per semester. I also previously did research under the supervison of Dr. Sean Bohun for my undergraduate thesis, where I studied the use of Kalman Filtering and its use in forecasting equities.  
    </p>
   
    <p>
        I am very interested in Machine Learning and its use in financial markets, and how we can use data in order to improve decision making in financial markets, or even
        make more informed decisions for us. Below you can find links to all my pet projects and papers that I have written for my own learning and also for school.

    <h3>Misc Stuff</h3>
    Some stuff about me not related to tech/finance/science that might be interesting:
    <ul>
        <li>I like to read a lot here is a list of books I am currently reading, read or going to read soon, and would encourage you to read as well, I try to aim for 12 books a year not including textbooks I read as well</li>
        <li>I am also a big movie and TV person, this is my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/chocolatem00se/", target=_blank>Letterboxd</a> feel free to follow, I occasionally write a review on a movie</li>
